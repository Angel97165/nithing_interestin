        <p class="ist">I met a girl)
            it happened that at that time she was the only person I was talking to, yes through the Internet, so when I had free time, I was waiting, waiting for her to be online, I was ready to talk to her 24/7 and I could listen to her forever, but unfortunately this will not happen (.
                       yes, I know 8 billion people, why did I become dependent on one, and I don't care how many people there are on this planet because I even felt comfortable with her, she always lifted my spirits and yes, I fell in love with her and even that was mutual. but I knew something was going to happen, you can say from time to time my intuition and mind told me about it, but I didn't listen ( 
           and then she wrote me this...</p>

           <p class="fr">"I like someone else, but I don't want to deceive you and I can't..."</p>

           <p></p>

           <p class="cont">and here I am sitting, sad, I literally want to break my hands just thinking about what "right now with
            someone else is communicating with her...", and I can't do anything except this site, which is a piece of shit that nobody has noticed and it's unlikely that anyone will come here. But they say that if you tell someone about your grief, it will be easier for you... but I don't know how to tell others about my problems, that's why I decided to do it and announced it to the whole Internet, but as I said, no one will read it.</p>
